### Abstract:
(Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

i built functionality for coupons in the previous little-shop API project, using postman to make sure i achieve CRUD functionality for coupons being added into the mix, and then creating a front end website to display how the database works with the added option of coupons.


### Installation Instructions:
(What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

clone down front and back end seperately, and run both in a server. go to the front end local hosted domain and then you are there.

### Preview of App:
(Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
(Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? What specific work/improvements did you contribute to this FE application?)

i had to work on it for at least a few hours every day, but the last few days i definitely worked a lot more... in the front end i completed the two endpoints (basically giving full functionality to the coupons section for merchants) and obviously messed around a bit afterwards.

### Learning Goals:
(What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

the learning goals were to get better understanding of front and back end on an api, and i feel i definitely did achieve that. I referenced previous database projects a lot, and did a lot of googling and asking chatgpt to explain certain syntax or built in rails functionality to me in an easy to understand way

### Wins + Challenges:
(What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

i think that the frontend is a win because i did not feel so great about it last project, but this one it just came to me. also doing both edge case/sad paths for the coupon creation was a bit challenging but i feel like doing both required sad paths on 1 function was a good idea in some ways instead of doing 2 completely different ones. i am also proud of myself for fixing almost everything after messing a lot up doing migrations slightly wrong and accidentally making it worse trying to correct it. i could definitely have gone further with the seeding data part though, s i could get some coupons assigned to invoices directly, and i also did run into 1 error that was just really confusing (it does not affect the functionality much thankfully) overall i think i did pretty well though.
